/** @brief #### `typedef struct` used as argument to `ks_pg_***` functions to control where and when to place a sequence object (e.g. KS_TRAP)

    For most sequence objects, the field `.board` should be one of:
    - XGRAD
    - YGRAD
    - ZGRAD
    - RHO
    - THETA
    - OMEGA

    For sequence objects operating on more than one gradient board at a time (like KS_EPI), the field `.board` denotes a combination of two axes:
    - KS_FREQX_PHASEY
    - KS_FREQY_PHASEX
    - KS_FREQX_PHASEZ
    - KS_FREQZ_PHASEX
    - KS_FREQY_PHASEZ
    - KS_FREQZ_PHASEY

    The `.ampscale` field must be in range [-1.0, 1.0] and modifies the designed KS_*** object on a per-instance basis. A few sequence functions (e.g. ks_pg_phaser()) ignores
    this value, but in general it is used to modify all, or a part, of a given KS_*** object


    ### Example

    \code{.c}
    @pg (TGT)
      KS_SEQLOC tmploc = KS_INIT_SEQLOC; // board-time-ampscale entity to control where and when a sequence object should be placed
      tmploc.board = XGRAD;
      tmploc.pos = 20ms;
      tmploc.ampscale = -1.0; // negate the amplitude of the KS_TRAP 'mytrap' designed by ks_eval_trap()
      ks_pg_trap(&mytrap, tmploc, ...); // place an instance of mytrap at absolute position 20ms (beginning of attack ramp) on XGRAD
    \endcode

/** @brief #### Core sequence object for making trapezoids on X,Y,Z, and OMEGA boards
    @image html KS_TRAP.png KS_TRAP
    <br>

    When making trapezoids on X, Y, or Z boards, the amplitude units are [G/cm], while units are arbitrary on OMEGA.

    First note that for RF slice selection, phase encoding, or readouts there are *other* sequence objects and functions that in use their own KS_TRAPs internally.

    Direct use of KS_TRAP objects applies only to cases where a standalone gradient with a certain area is desired, usually acting as a gradient spoiler.
    To add a trapezoid to a pulse sequence as e.g. a gradient spoiler, first declare a KS_TRAP sequence object in the `@ipgexport` section (see example below).
    In `cveval()`, the desired area of the trapezoid (unit: [(G/cm) us]) is then set by assigning a value to the `.area` field in the KS_TRAP object.
    This serves as input information, from which the duration, ramptime, and amplitude is calculated by calling ks_eval_trap().
    The second argument to ks_eval_trap(..., "name", ...) is the *description* that is inserted into the `.description` field of the KS_TRAP.
    On TGT, this name is also used in when naming the WF_PULSEs internally, with a '.#' suffix added at the end, where '#' is the first letter of the board
    it is placed on. Hence, for a description called "myspoiler", it will appear in TimeHist in *MGD Sim/WTools* as `myspoiler.xa` (ramp-up), `myspoiler.x` (plateau),
    and `myspoiler.xd` if it is placed on board XGRAD.

    The general function for setting up a KS_TRAP is ks_eval_trap(), where slewrate and gradient amplitude are constrained by the default system
    limits to allow for *simultaneous* use on all 3 axis at the same time. The slewrate and gradient amplitude limits can be slacked if one
    can be sure that the KS_TRAP will be used on one or two axes at a time, by instead calling ks_eval_trap1() or ks_eval_trap2(). The difference is
    seen for (double) oblique slices, where strong slice angulation and the use of ks_eval_trap1() can produce up to 3x stronger gradient than ks_eval_trap().
    These `ks_eval_trap***()` functions are all calling the one and same ks_eval_trap_constrained() function, where slewrate and gradient amplitude limits as
    well as minimum plateautime are explicitly given as input arguments. This function can also be called directly. In summary, call:

    - ks_eval_trap()  - for generic use
    - ks_eval_trap1() - if this trapezoid will be placed on one board at a time, with no other gradients running on other boards simultaneously. This will
                        increase the maximum amplitude for double oblique scans by up to 3 times.
    - ks_eval_trap2() - if this trapezoid will be placed on at most two boards at a time with no other gradients running on other boards simultaneously
    - ks_eval_trap_constrained() - if manual control of slewrate, gradient max and minimum plateau time is desired

    Once a KS_TRAP object has been *designed* using ks_eval_trap(), the same KS_TRAP object can be freely placed on XGRAD, YGRAD and ZGRAD
    as many times as desired, by only changing the second argument each time (to avoid waveform overlaps). The second argument is a KS_SEQLOC struct with three fields:
    - `.board`: Choose between XGRAD, YGRAD, ZGRAD (or OMEGA)
    - `.pos`: Absolute time in [us] of the start of the attack ramp of the trapezoid
    - `.ampscale`: A factor that must be in range [-1.0,1.0] that is multiplied with `.amp` to yield a per-instance (i.e. per-placement) amplitude ([G/cm]).
    The simplest is to use 1.0, which makes the KS_TRAP object to be placed out on the board as initially designed using ks_eval_trap().

    NOTE: Regardless of the order placed out in the `@pg` section, and on which boards (XGRAD, YGRAD, ZGRAD) the KS_TRAP object is placed, the *instance* number of the KS_TRAP
    is automatically sorted in time. If two instances of one KS_TRAP occur at the same time (`.pos`) on different boards, XGRAD comes before YGRAD, which comes before ZGRAD.
    These abstract, sorted, instance numbers are used by `ks_scan_***() functions in scan() to refer to a specific instance of a KS_TRAP object in the sequence.

    When a trapezoid is placed on OMEGA, neither the designed amplitude (`.amp` field in KS_TRAP) nor the `.ampscale` (in KS_SEQLOC) has an effect on the final frequency modulation.
    Instead the run-time amplitude of a KS_TRAP object on the OMEGA board is controlled in scan() via a function called ks_scan_omegatrap_hz().

    Advanced tip: After calling ks_eval_trap(), the field `.duration` will correspond to the total duration of the trapezoid. If one manually sets this field to 0
    (after ks_eval_trap()), ks_pg_trap() will detect the zero duration and ignore placing this out in the `@pg` section without an error.
    This can sometimes be a convienient way of conditionally or temporarily disable a trapezoid.
    Moreover, sequence dependent timing functions also see this trapezoid having zero duration, making timing calculations to correspond
    well to the ignored placement of the trapezoid in the `@pg` section.

    In scan() on TGT, the amplitude of each instance of the KS_TRAP object can be individually scaled in run-time using ks_scan_trap_ampscale().
    The third argument to this function is another amplitude scaling factor that must be in range [-1.0,1.0]. The final amplitude of the trapezoid in [G/cm]
    becomes the product of the following:
    - `.amp ` field of KS_TRAP (set by ks_eval_trap() in `cveval()`)
    - `.ampscale` field of KS_SEQLOC (2nd arg to ks_pg_trap() in the `@pg` section that alters each instance)
    - 3rd argument to ks_scan_trap_ampscale()

    It is a *requirement* that there is a (*sequence generating*) function in the `@pg` section (containing the ks_pg_trap() call(s)) that can be run on both HOST and TGT. This
    function should be called exactly once in `cveval()` (after ks_eval_trap() and other `ks_eval_***()` functions). ks_pg_trap() will throw an error on TGT if this has not been done.
    See KS_SEQ_CONTROL for an example

    The `.gradnum[]` array is modified by ks_pg_trap() when run on HOST, to keep count of how many times the KS_TRAP will be placed in the `@pg` section. This information is used
    in ks_eval_gradrflimits() together with the sequence module's common KS_SEQ_CONTROL object to calculate gradient heating limits for the sequence module.

/** @brief #### Core sequence object making arbitrary waveforms on any board (using float data format)
    @image html KS_WAVE.png KS_WAVE
    <br>

    The KS_WAVE sequence object contains a KS_WAVEFORM (`float[KS_MAXWAVELEN]`) to hold the waveform. The physical unit of the waveform in the KS_WAVE
    object depends the board on which it is placed in pulsegen(). For the
    - gradient boards (XGRAD, YGRAD, ZGRAD), the unit is [G/cm]
    - THETA board, the unit is [degrees]
    - RF and OMEGA boards, the units are arbitrary (c.f. ks_eval_rf() and ks_eval_wave())

    Similar to the KS_TRAP sequence object, KS_WAVE is a core object used in other objects such as KS_RF. For RF pulse generation, direct use of
    KS_WAVE functions in e.g. `cveval()` or in the `@pg` section should be *avoided* as there is no mechanism to do the proper RF scaling. For RF, use instead KS_RF and KS_SELRF.

    Placing out a KS_WAVE is done in the `@pg` section using ks_pg_wave().
    A key feature with ks_pg_wave() is that all waveforms are double buffered. This allows replacing waveforms in run-time (scan()) from TR to TR. As ks_pg_wave() is used
    for all sequence objects dealing with waves, RF pulses, THETA, and OMEGA waveforms in the KS_RF objects are all double buffered as well.
    To replace a waveform in scan(), the function ks_scan_wave2hardware() is used.

    The `.gradnum[]` field is modified by ks_pg_wave() on HOST to keep count of how many times the KS_WAVE has been placed in the `@pg` section. This information is used
    in ks_eval_gradrflimits() together with the sequence's common KS_SEQ_CONTROL object to calculate gradient heating limits for the sequence.

    NOTE: Regardless of the order placed out in the `@pg` section, and on which boards (XGRAD, YGRAD, ZGRAD) the KS_WAVE object is placed, the *instance* number of the KS_WAVE
    is automatically sorted in time. If two instances of one KS_WAVE occur at the same time (`.pos`) on different boards, XGRAD comes before YGRAD, which comes before ZGRAD.
    These abstract, sorted, instance numbers are used by ks_scan_***() functions in scan() to refer to a specific instance of a KS_WAVE object in the sequence. However,
    unlike KS_TRAP, replacing e.g. a waveform in run-time for an instance of a KS_WAVE will affect all instances on the same board. This, since there is only one hardwave
    waveform per board for each KS_WAVE.

    It is a *requirement* that there is a (*sequence generating*) function in the `@pg` section (containing the ks_pg_wave() call(s)) that can be run on both HOST and TGT. This
    function should be called exactly once in `cveval()` (after ks_eval_wave() and other `ks_eval_***()` functions). ks_pg_wave() will throw an error on TGT if this has not been done.
    See KS_SEQ_CONTROL for an example

/** @brief #### Core sequence object that handles a data acquisition window
    @image html KS_READ.png KS_READ
    <br>

    The KS_READ core sequence object is responsible for acquiring data in a certain time window using some receiver bandwidth [kHz]. Direct use of KS_READ
    applies to cases like MR spectroscopy where no gradients are involved during data acquisition. It can also be used together with a KS_WAVE to make
    arbitrary non-Cartesian readouts (as there is currently no composite object ready to handle non-Cartesian readouts).

    The information necessary for an acquisition window is:
    - `.rbw`  - the desired receiver bandwidth / FOV in [kHz] (max: 250)
    - `.duration` - the duration in [us]

    On calling ks_eval_read() in `cveval()` the function will validate the desired rBW and round it to the nearest valid value. Also the duration will be rounded up
    to fit a whole number of samples in the acquisition window.

    NOTE: Regardless of the order the KS_READ object is placed out in the `@pg` section, its *instance* index is automatically sorted in time, like KS_TRAP and KS_WAVE.
    Hence, `myacqwin.echo[0]` in the example below will always be the first acquisition window in time belonging to this KS_READ object. The number of instances of
    each KS_READ object in the sequence is given by `.base.ngenerated` (on TGT) and `.base.ninst` (on HOST). In scan(), use `.base.ngenerated` instead of
    relying on other variables such as `opnecho` when e.g. calling `loaddab()`.

    It is a *requirement* that there is a (*sequence generating*) function in the `@pg` section (containing the ks_pg_read() call(s)) that can be run on both HOST and TGT. This
    function should be called exactly once in `cveval()` (after ks_eval_read() and other `ks_eval_***()` functions). ks_pg_read() will throw an error on TGT if this has not been done.

/** @brief #### Composite sequence object for RF (with optional OMEGA & THETA pulses)
    @image html KS_RF.png KS_RF
    <br>

    The composite KS_RF sequence object holds all information necessary to create RF pulses, both real and freq/phase modulated ones.
    For RF pulses with slice selection, use a KS_SELRF object instead, which contains a KS_RF object and KS_TRAP objects. The KS_RF object (be it standalone or
    a part of KS_SELRF) needs to be set up along the lines described here

    ### RF Design

    Independent of the design method chosen (see below), KS_RF has some field members worth mentioning:
    - `.role`: This is a label for the *role* of the RF pulse. This information is primarily used by ks_eval_selrf() to determine what gradients to apply
      for slice selection. Valid values for `.role` are
      - KS_RF_ROLE_EXC (for excitation)
      - KS_RF_ROLE_REF (for refocusing)
      - KS_RF_ROLE_CHEMSAT (for fat-sat, non-slice selective)
      - KS_RF_ROLE_INV (for inversion)
      - KS_RF_ROLE_SPSAT (for spatial saturation)
    - `.flip`: The desired flip angle of the RF pulse [degrees]
    - `.bw`: The bandwidth of the RF pulse [Hz]
    - `.iso2end` and `.start2iso`: These fields are for convenience and easier timing calculations and are set in ks_eval_rf().
       The value of `.iso2end` is equal to `.rfpulse.isodelay` and refers to the time from the effective center of the RF pulse to the end.
       Field `.iso2end` must have a correct value before calling ks_eval_rf().
       The `.start2iso` field is the time from the beginning of the RF pulse to its effective center, calculated as `.rfwave.duration - .iso2end` in ks_eval_rf()
    - `.cf_offset`: is used to change the relative center frequency for non-slice selective RFs. A typical application is non-slice selective
       fat saturation.
    - `.designinfo`: is an optional string to keep track of useful RF design details (mostly for debugging purposes), and it is up to the
       user to fill this in, except for some pre-generated RF pulses available in KSFoundation_GERF.h
    - `.amp`: This field is set to 1 by ks_eval_rf(), but will get a proper value after calling GEReq_eval_rfscaling().
       The value of `.amp` is used in the `@pg` section by ks_pg_rf() to properly amplitude scale the actual RF waveform before internally calling ks_pg_wave()
       using the `.rfwave` field.

    #### Method 1: Using pre-defined KS_RF objects
    The simplest way to create a KS_RF object is to use one of the RF pulses in GE's product sequences, some of which are available in KSFoundation_GERF.h.
    To use these ready-made RF pulses, perform the following steps:
    1. Declare a KS_RF object in the `@ipgexport` section
       - `KS_RF myrf = KS_INIT_RF;`
    2. Assign the KS_RF object after choosing one in KSFoundation_GERF.h
       - e.g. `myrf = exc_fse90;`
    3. Call ks_eval_rf() or ks_eval_selrf() to name and initialize the RF pulse

    The field `.flip` can be changed anytime between ks_eval_rf() and GEReq_eval_rfscaling(), e.g. by setting `.flip = opflip`

    #### Method 2: Creating Sinc RF pulses
    For small flip angles, the Fourier transform of the RF envelope is a good approximation of the final slice profile and SLR designed pulses may not be necessary.
    For these cases, the function ks_eval_rf_sinc() can be used to create a Sinc RF pulse (as a KS_RF object) with a desired
    bandwidth (BW), time-bandwidth-product (TBW) and window function (e.g. KS_RF_SINCWIN_HAMMING), as follows:
    1. Declare a KS_RF object in the `@ipgexport` section
       - `KS_RF mysincrf = KS_INIT_RF;`
    2. Call ks_eval_rf_sinc() to populate the KS_RF object
       - The *duration* of the RF pulse (`mysincrf.rfwave.duration`) depends on the chosen BW and TBW
    3. Assign the *role* of the RF pulse
       - `mysincrf.role = KS_RF_ROLE_EXC; // or KS_RF_ROLE_REF, KS_RF_ROLE_INV, KS_RF_ROLE_CHEMSAT`

    Note that in most scenarios a KS_SELRF is used instead of a KS_RF, as Sinc RFs are typically used with slice selection. Hence, in practice,
    a KS_SELRF should be declared, and the above procedure should be applied to the `.rf` field (of type KS_RF) in the KS_SELRF object.

    #### Method 3: Creating custom RF pulses
    Another method is to copy a waveform designed elsewhere into the `.rfwave` (KS_WAVE) field of the KS_RF object.
    This can be done from either memory (ks_eval_wave()) or disk (ks_eval_wave_file()).

    Assuming we have an RF envelope in some float array `myexternalrfwave[]`, the following steps are performed:
    1. Declare a KS_RF object in the `@ipgexport` section
       - `KS_RF mycustomrf = KS_INIT_RF;`
    2. Call ks_eval_wave() as `ks_eval_wave(&mycustomrf.rfwave, "", res, duration, myexternalrfwave);`
       - If the RF pulse should use a THETA or OMEGA waveform, do the same procedure for the fields `.thetawave` and/or `.omegawave`
       - *res* should be number of elements in *myexternalrfwave*
       - *duration* (in [us]) must be an integer multiple (>= 2x) of *res*
    3. Assign the following fields manually:
       - `.role`
       - `.flip` [degrees] (will also be the nominal flip angle)
       - `.bw` [Hz]
       - `.iso2end` [us]    (the time from effective center of the RF pulse to the end)
    4. Call ks_eval_rfstat() to populate the RF_PULSE struct (`mycustomrf.rfpulse`) that is needed for RF scaling and SAR calculations
       - Note that ks_eval_rfstat() only works for real RF pulses (without THETA or OMEGA waveforms). For complex RF pulses, the `.rfpulse` struct
         needs to be set up manually
    5. Call ks_eval_rf() or ks_eval_selrf() to name and initialize the RF pulse, and to let the KS_SEQ_CONTROL struct link to it for later RF scaling
       in ks_eval_gradrflimits()


    ### Automatic RF scaling and SAR calculations (for sequences written entirely using KSFoundation)
    First make sure there is a separate *sequence making function* in the `@pg` section that holds all function calls to the various `ks_pg_***()` functions building up the sequence.
    E.g. there is a ksfse_pg() function in ksfse.e.
    - It is crucial that this function, only when called on HOST at the end of the function, sets `seqctrl.min_duration` to a value corresponding to the number of us to the end of the sequence module (see example below).
    - As this *sequence making function*  is to be played out in both `cveval()` (on HOST) and in `pulsegen()` in the `@pg` section (on TGT), UsePgenOnHost() must be set in the Imakefile
    - Multiple sequence modules (such as main sequence, FatSat, Inversion etc.), each with its own KS_SEQ_CONTROL handle and sequence making function, are added to one common KS_SEQ_COLLECTION for
      all sequence modules involved. This KS_SEQ_COLLECTION struct is passed both to RF scaling (GEReq_eval_rfscaling()) and SAR handling (GEReq_eval_checkTR_SAR(), which calls ks_eval_gradrflimits()) routines.
    - Please see KS_SEQ_COLLECTION for more information on the order of events necessary in `cveval()` to perform RF scaling and SAR handling. **


    ### Example for a pulse sequence entirely written in KSFoundation

    \code{.c}
    @ipgexport (HOST)
    KS_RF myfatsat = KS_INIT_RF;
    KS_SEQ_CONTROL seqctrl;

    @host

    cveval() {
      KS_SEQ_COLLECTION seqcollection;
      ks_init_seqcollection(&seqcollection);

      if (cffield == 30000)
        myfatsat = chemsat_cs3t; // chemsat_cs3t is a const KS_RF declared in KSFoundation_GERF.h
      else
        myfatsat = chemsat_csm; // chemsat_csm is a const KS_RF declared in KSFoundation_GERF.h

      ks_eval_rf(&myfatsat, "myfatsat");

      mypsd_pg(); // at the end of mypsd_pg(), seqctrl.min_duration needs to be set to the absolute end time in [us] of this sequence (module)

      // add this sequence module to the sequence collection
      ks_eval_addtoseqcollection(&seqcollection, &seqctrl);

      // perform RF scaling using all sequence modules to be used (e.g. main sequence, FatSat, Inversion etc.)
      GEReq_eval_rfscaling(&seqcollection);

      // TR timing, slice ordering and SAR calcs, in four steps.
      // Here we assume there is a wrapper function (mysliceloop_nargs(int slperpass, int nargs, void **args)) to the sequence's sliceloop function (e.g. mysliceloop()),
      // where e.g. mysliceloop_nargs(7, 0, NULL) plays out seven 2D slices and returns the slice loop duration in [us]
      // Also, it is assumed the the sliceloop function calls ks_scan_playsequence() to accumulate the time required for all its sequence modules

      // Step 1: Calculate # slices per TR and how much spare time we have within the current TR by running the slice loop
      //         Output 1: slperpass - Number of slices that fit within the selected TR (optr)
      //         Output 2: timetoadd_perTR - The necessary filling time to reach the set TR, given slperpass slices
      GEReq_eval_TR(&slperpass, &timetoadd_perTR, 0, seqcollection, mysliceloop_nargs, 0, NULL);

      // Step 2: Calculate the slice plan (slice sorting over one or more passes) and passes (acqs) for normal interleaved 2D imaging
      //          ks_slice_plan is passed to GEReq_predownload_store_sliceplan() in predownload()
      ks_calc_sliceplan(&ks_slice_plan, exist(opslquant), slperpass);

      // Step 3: Spread the available `timetoadd_perTR` evenly on the main sequence module, by increasing the .duration of each slice by timetoadd_perTR/slperpass
      seqctrl.duration = RUP_GRD(seqctrl.duration + CEIL_DIV(timetoadd_perTR, ks_slice_plan.nslices_per_pass));

      // Step 4: Check that TR is fullfilled by dryrunning the slice loop with updated seqctrl.duration fields for the sequence modules involved.
      //         Update SAR values in the UI (error will occur if the sum of sequence durations differs from optr)
      GEReq_eval_checkTR_SAR(seqcollection, ks_slice_plan.nslices_per_pass, mysliceloop_nargs, 0, NULL);

    } // end of cveval()


    @pg

    }
    \endcode

    ### RF scaling when KS_RF object(s) are added to an *existing standard EPIC* sequence
    When KS_RF objects are added to an existing GE product sequence (or any other standard EPIC sequence), RF scaling and SAR calculations
    are already taken care of for the non-KSFoundation RF-pulses. To include also the KS_RF pulses (including the KS_RF objects in KS_SELRF) as
    a part of the main sequence's RF scaling, the following steps are needed:
    1. Add one new *SLOT* in the `rfpulse[]` struct array for each KS_RF (or KS_SELRF) object by editing `grad_rf_<psdname>.h`. The file `grad_rf_empty.h` in
       the KSFoundation folder can be used as a template. This only serves a place holder to fill up space in `rfpulse[]`, and no need to
       edit the `grad_rf_<psdname>.h` further
    2. Increase `RF_FREE1` (sometimes `RF_FREE2`) in `grad_rf_<psdname>.globals.h` and add `defines` for the new slots
    3. After setting up the KS_RF objects using one of the methods above, make sure the `.rfpulse` field of each KS_RF object has the fields:
       - `.activity = PSD_SCAN_ON`
       - `.num = <number of instances of this KS_RF object in the sequence>`
    4. Copy the `.rfpulse` field of each KS_RF object in to each corresponding *SLOT* in the `rfpulse[]` array. E.g.:
       - `rfpulse[MYOWNFATSAT_SLOT] = myfatsat.rfpulse;` where `MYOWNFATSAT_SLOT` has been defined as an available number less than RF_FREE1
         in `grad_rf_<psdname>.globals.h`

/** @brief #### A multi-purpose controller struct for each sequence module to facilitate RF scaling, SAR calculations, sequence duration and sequence switching
    @image html KS_SEQ_CONTROL.png KS_SEQ_CONTROL
    <br>

    Each sequence module in the pulse sequence should have a dedicated KS_SEQ_CONTROL struct associated with it. For example, one may have the following KS_SEQ_CONTROL structs in a pulse sequence,
    where there is one main sequence and an fatsat module plugin that technically are two sequences - or sequence modules - (via the use of KS_SEQLENGTH()):
    - mymainseqctrl    - Sequence control for the main sequence, i.e. the only sequence that is storing data (the *actual* sequence)
    - fatsatseqctrl - Sequence control for the fatsat sequence module

    The KS_SEQ_CONTROL struct has multiple uses and could be viewed as the *administrator* for each sequence module. Here is a list of uses and steps neccesary to achieve the intended functionality:

    #### In `cveval()` on HOST:

    - Collection of information on how many times each KS_TRAP or KS_RF object is placed out in `pulsegen()` for the particular sequence module.
      - Preferrably, there is a *sequence generating function* that may be named e.g. *seqmodulename*`_pg()`, which contains all ks_pg_trap(), ks_pg_rf() (and other `ks_pg_***()`) calls that
        build up the sequence module by placing out its sequence objects. The KS_SEQ_CONTROL struct for the current sequence module should be the last argument to each `ks_pg_***()` call in *seqmodulename*`_pg()`.
      - By running *seqmodulename*`_pg()` in `cveval()` the `seqctrl.gradrf` field will be updated with pointers to its sequence objects, allowing `seqctrl` to also know the number of occurrences of each trapezoid or RF.
      - This information is used for RF scaling, gradient heating and SAR calculations, after adding the sequence modules to one common KS_SEQ_COLLECTION struct using ks_eval_addtoseqcollection().
    - Somewhere in `cveval()`, the SSI time for the sequence modules needs to be set. This is the time the sequence module needs to update its waveforms from one playout to the next during scanning.
      Often 1 ms is enough, but for long sequence modules it may need to be increased, especially if debugging outputs are used. It can also be set lower, sometimes down to about 0.1 ms.
    - In `cveval()`, the *seqmodulename*`_pg()` function for each sequence module should be called *after* the `ks_eval_***()` calls setting up the sequence objects, but *before* the TR timing, RF scaling and SAR calculations.
      Inside each *seqmodulename*`_pg()` function the `.duration` and `.min_duration` fields of the KS_SEQ_CONTROL struct should be set to the actual minimum duration
      of the sequence module (the [us] value corresponding to the absolute position of the last gradient or RF waveform). See ks_eval_seqctrl_setminduration() in the example below.


    #### On TGT:

    - In `pulsegen()`: The KS_SEQ_CONTROL struct is the 2nd arg to KS_SEQLENGTH(), which defines the hardware sequence duration (using the `seqctrl.duration` value) for the sequence module.
      Using KS_SEQLENGTH() instead of GE's SEQLENGTH() macro allows sequence module playouts, and switching between modules, in `scan()` using ks_scan_playsequence().
    - In `scan()`, and its psd-specific subroutines: The KS_SEQ_CONTROL struct is passed to ks_scan_playsequence() to switch to and play out this sequence module in real time during scanning. ks_scan_playsequence() also returns `seqctrl.duration`, allowing
      timing checks on HOST by dry-running scan functions in `cveval()`. E.g. the scan clock is set by GE's `pitscan` variable, which can be set by calling `scanloop()` in the simplified example below.

/** @brief #### Collection handle of all sequence modules involved in the pulse sequence, used for RF scaling, TR timing and SAR calculations

    A pulse sequence consists of one or more sequence modules - one of them being the main pulse sequence, while the other ones may be add-on features like e.g. FatSat, Inversion etc.
    These sequence modules, each having its own KS_SEQ_CONTROL struct, are played in `scan()` according to some pattern. As a collection they produce some:
    - total duration for the given number of slices
    - SAR given the various RF pulses involved in the sequence modules

    To perform an overarching RF scaling (accounting also for the prescan RF pulses), TR timing and SAR calculation, the collection of sequence modules (KS_SEQ_COLLECTION) involved is used.

    While the KS_SEQ_CONTROL struct could be viewed as the administrator for *each* sequence module, there is a single KS_SEQ_COLLECTION struct administrating the *entire* pulse sequence. This KS_SEQ_COLLECTION handle
    is only needed in `cveval()` and is passed to GEReq_eval_rfscaling(), GEReq_eval_TR(), and GEReq_eval_checkTR_SAR(), which should all be called in `cveval()`.

    A sequence module (KS_SEQ_CONTROL) is added to the sequence collection (KS_SEQ_COLLECTION) by calling ks_eval_addtoseqcollection(), but it will be added only if `seqctrl.duration > 0` . Setting *mypluginmodule*`.duration = 0`
    indicates *don't use*, and hence it will neither be a part of RF scaling or SAR calculations. Moreover, since ks_scan_playsequence() in `scan()` checks if `seqctrl.duration = 0`
    (returns 0 duration and skips playing the module in `scan()`), the TR timing follows automatically.

    This is also analogous to how KS_TRAP, KS_RF and other sequence objects, on a smaller scale, are ignored by the `ks_pg_***()` functions if the `.duration` field is set to 0.

 * #### Background
 * For 2D imaging one can fit a certain number of slices within each TR, and one may often need multiple TRs (or passes) to play out
 * all slices. GE's product sequences uses the following CVs:
 * - `opslquant` (number of slices in total, taken from the prescribed slices in the UI)
 * - `slquant1` (number of slices that can fit within one TR)
 * - `acqs` (number of passes, acquisitions, or TRs necessary to acquire all slices)

 * Then typically `orderslice()` is called to set up the global `data_acq_order` array, which is used in the reconstruction
 *
 * #### ks_slice_plan
 * This is replaced with one `ks_slice_plan`, effectively making `acqs` and `slquant1` obsolete, and making `scan()` only dependent on one KS_SLICE_PLAN.
 * This is e.g. beneficial for multiband (SMS) imaging, where there is one slice plan for the calibration step and another slice plan for the
 * slice-accelerated scan.
 *
 * Multiple functions can exist to create different KS_SLICE_PLANs (instead of using `orderslice()`), and for standard interleaved 2D imaging (odd slices followed by
 * even slices), there is aleady a ks_calc_sliceplan() function, which in turn calls ks_calc_sliceplan_interleaved(), where the level of slice interleaving can be set.
 *
 * As GE's `data_acq_order()` is critical for the image reconstruction, this has to be filled in correctly before scanning, and this is done
 * by store the `ks_slice_plan` information by calling GEReq_predownload_store_sliceplan() in predownload().
 *
 * `ks_slice_plan` is declared as KS_SLICE_PLAN in GERequired.e, hence there is no need to declare it for each pulse sequence.

/** @brief #### Composite sequence object for slice-selective RF
    @image html KS_SELRF.png KS_SELRF
    <br>

    The KS_SELRF composite sequence object contains a KS_RF object and three KS_TRAP objects and an optional KS_WAVE object. The purpose of the KS_SELRF
    object is to provide a complete functionality for slice selection. Depending on the declared *role* (`.rf.role`), and the fields like
    `.slthick`, the KS_TRAP objects will be set up differently in ks_eval_selrf(). The KS_TRAP fields in KS_SELRF are:
    - `.pregrad`: A gradient that *may* be present *before* the RF slice selection
    - `.grad`: The slice selection gradient that is applied at the same time as the KS_RF RF pulse
    - `.postgrad`: A gradient that *may* be present *after* the RF slice selection

    The following values of `.rf.role` are allowed:
    - `KS_RF_ROLE_EXC`, indicating an RF *excitation* role. ks_eval_selrf() will in this case:
      - disable `.pregrad`
      - make `.grad` to have a plateautime equal to the RF duration (`.rf.rfwave.duration`) and the gradient amplitude (`.grad.amp` [G/cm])
        will be set to the proper value, depending on the BW (`.rf.bw`) and slice thickness (`.slthick`). Note that the slice thickness often needs to be made
        larger to compensate from slice narrowing due to multiple RF pulses. GE uses `gscale_rfX` CVs with values often between 0.8-0.9. Dividing with this number
        gives a thicker slice in the calculations. The field `.grad.description` will have a ".trap" suffix added to it
      - make `.postgrad` to have a gradient area that rephases the slice. This is dependent on the isodelay of the RF pulse (`.rf.iso2end`) and the slice select
        gradient amplitude (`.grad.amp`). The field `.postgrad.description` will have a ".reph" suffix added to it
    - `KS_RF_ROLE_REF`, indicating an RF *refocusing* role. ks_eval_selrf() will in this case:
      - use `.pregrad` to make the left crusher (never *bridged* with slice selection). The size of the crusher can be controlled by `.crusherscale`.
        The field `.pregrad.description` will have a ".LC" suffix added to it
      - do the same with `.grad` as done for `KS_RF_ROLE_EXC`
      - use `.postgrad` to make the right crusher (never *bridged* with slice selection). The size of the crusher can be controlled by `.crusherscale`.
        The field `.postgrad.description` will have a ".RC" suffix added to it
    - `KS_RF_ROLE_INV`, indicating an RF *inversion* role. ks_eval_selrf() will in this case:
      - disable `.pregrad`
      - do the same with `.grad` as done for `KS_RF_ROLE_EXC`
      - disable `.postgrad`
    - `KS_RF_ROLE_SPSAT`, indicating a *spatial RF saturation*. ks_eval_selrf() will in this case:
      - disable `.pregrad`
      - do the same with `.grad` as done for `KS_RF_ROLE_EXC`
      - use `.postgrad` to make a gradient spoiler (never *bridged* with slice selection). The size of the spoiler can be controlled by `.crusherscale`.
        The field `.postgrad.description` will have a ".spoiler" suffix added to it

    The role `KS_RF_ROLE_CHEMSAT`, indicates a non-slice selective, chemically selective, RF (usually *fat-sat*). ks_eval_selrf() will in this case throw an error since
    no gradients should be used

    With ks_eval_selrf(), the default slewrate and maximum gradient amplitude are used for the KS_TRAP objects, and it is possible (with few applications) to play out
    three simultaneous gradients during slice selection. For oblique slices, the maximum gradient strength will however be reduced.
    For high-bandwidth RF pulses and thin slices, it may be beneficial to allow for a larger maximum gradient strength for oblique slice planes. This can be done by instead
    calling:
    - ks_eval_selrf1(): where one *promises* that only one (1) gradient (trapezoid) will be played out at a time during slice selection (i.e. no other gradients
      are active on other boards during this time). This is usually the case anyway for slice selection, hence the ks_eval_selrf1() function could be used as standard
    - ks_eval_selrf2(): where one *promises* that maximum two (2) gradients will be played out at a time during slice selection. This gives a maxiumum gradient amplitude
      that lies in between that of ks_eval_selrf() and ks_eval_selrf1()
    - ks_eval_selrf_constrained(): where full control is given to the *slewrate* and the *maximum gradient strength*

    #### Using a custom gradient wave for slice selection
    To support e.g. VERSEd RF excitations, a custom gradient wave can be used.

    If `.gradwave.res > 0`, ks_eval_selrf() will disable `.grad` and use `.gradwave` instead.
    When `.rf.role = KS_RF_ROLE_EXC`, the rephasing gradient area (in `.postgrad`) will also be calculated by integrating the gradient waveform
    from the RF isocenter to the end. `.gradwave` must be created *before* calling ks_eval_selrf() using either ks_eval_wave() or ks_eval_wave_file(), and the units must
    be in [G/cm]. To further scale the amplitude of `.gradwave` before calling ks_pg_selrf(), consider e.g. ks_wave_multiplyval(), ks_wave_absmax(), and possibly
    ks_wave_addval().

    In the `@pg` section,  if `.gradwave.res > 0`, ks_pg_selrf() will place out the `.gradwave` instead of `.grad`. As all KS_WAVE objects are double buffered,
    it is possible to swap out the gradient waveform in `scan() if necessary.

    It is a *requirement* that there is a (*sequence generating*) function in the `@pg` section (containing the ks_pg_selrf() call(s)) that can be run on both HOST and TGT. This
    function should be called once in `cveval()` (after ks_eval_selrf() and other `ks_eval_***()` functions). ks_pg_selrf() will throw an error on TGT if this has not been done.
    An error will also occur on TGT if the RF pulse and the associated KS_SEQ_CONTROL struct governing the sequence (module) has not undergone RF scaling using GEReq_eval_rfscaling().

/** @brief #### Composite sequence object for data readout using a trapezoid gradient
    @image html KS_READTRAP.png KS_READTRAP
    <br>

    KS_READTRAP is a composite sequence object used to read out data while a trapezoid is played out, which is applicable to Cartesian, propeller and radial pulse sequences. The KS_READTRAP object
    is set up by calling ks_eval_readtrap(), but before calling this function, the following fields in KS_READTRAP must be set up:
    1. `.fov`: Desired image Field-of-View (FOV) in [mm] along the sequence board one intends to place the KS_READTRAP on (typically XGRAD)
    2. `.res`: Number of pixels within the FOV
    3. `.acq.rbw`: Receiver bandwidth (rBW) in [kHz/FOV]. Maximum is 250
    4. `.rampsampling`: If non-zero, data acquisition will be performed on the ramps of the trapezoid as well. This reduces the readout time, especially for high rBWs.
    5. `.acqdelay`: Needs to be set only if `.rampsampling = 1`. The `.acqdelay` (in [us]) will dictate the time from the start of the ramp-up until
       data acquisition will begin
    6. `.nover`: Number of *overscans*. If 0, a full echo will be generated (filling k-space). If > 0, fractional echo (i.e. shorter TE) will be set up with
       `.nover` number of extra sample points beyond `.res/2`.
       The total number of samples will be `.res/2 + .nover`. Values of `.nover` between 1 and about 16 should be avoided since half Fourier reconstruction
       methods will likely have difficulties
    7. `.freqoffHz`: Static offset frequency in Hz. Can be used to e.g. center fat instead of water

    If the KS_READTRAP object is initialized with KS_INIT_READTRAP, the fields `.nover`, `.rampsampling`, `.acqdelay` and `.freqoffHz` will all be zero (steps 4-7 can be skipped)

    Based on the information in the KS_READTRAP object, ks_eval_readtrap() will set up its `.grad` trapezoid (KS_TRAP) and its acquisition window `.acq` (KS_READ).

    If `.rampsampling = 1`, ks_eval_readtrap() will also copy the shape of `.grad` into `.omega` (also KS_TRAP).
    This is needed for FOV-offsets in the readout direction when data acquisition is done on both the ramps and on the plateau,
    and ks_pg_readtrap() and ks_scan_offsetfov() will handle the `.omega` KS_TRAP so that the intended FOV shift in [mm] will be performed.

    ks_eval_readtrap() will also fill in the convenience fields `.area2center` and `.time2center` properly. `.area2center` is useful to use as desired input `.area` for a read dephaser,
    and `.time2center` makes sequence timing calculations easier. Both fields take partial/full Fourier (`.nover`) into account.

    It is a *requirement* that there is a (*sequence generating*) function in the `@pg` section (containing the ks_pg_readtrap() call(s)) that can be run on both HOST and TGT. This
    function should be called once in `cveval()` (after ks_eval_readtrap() and other `ks_eval_***()` functions). ks_pg_readtrap() will throw an error on TGT if this has not been done.

/** @brief #### Composite sequence object for phase encoding using a trapezoid gradient
    @image html KS_PHASER.png KS_PHASER
    <br>

    KS_PHASER is a composite sequence object that is used for phase encoding. 2D Cartesian imaging requires one KS_PHASER, while 3D Cartesian imaging requires two different
    KS_PHASER objects, each with its own FOV, resolution and acceleration. The KS_PHASER object is set up by calling ks_eval_phaser(), but before calling this function,
    the following fields in KS_PHASER must be set up:
    1. `.fov`: The desired image Field-of-View (FOV) in [mm] along the sequence board one intends to place the KS_PHASER on (typically YGRAD, for 3D also ZGRAD)
    2. `.res`: The number of pixels within the FOV
    3. `.nover`: Number of *overscans*. If 0, a full-Fourier k-space will be set up. If > 0, partial Fourier will be set up (shorter scan time) where
       `.nover` number of extra k-space lines beyond `.res/2`. If < 0, partial Fourier will be set up, but with flipped k-space coverage.
       The total number of samples will be `.res/2 + .nover`. Values of `.nover` between 1 and about 16 should be avoided since half Fourier reconstruction
       methods will likely have difficulties.
    4. `.R`: The parallel imaging acceleration factor
    5. `.nacslines`: If `.R > 1`, `.nacslines` is the number of calibration lines around k-space center for parallel imaging calibration.
    6. `.areaoffset`: It is possible to embed a static gradient area in the phase encoding functionality of KS_PHASER. This is useful for 3D imaging, where
       the area needed for the rephaser of the slice select gradient can be put into `.areaoffset`. This makes the KS_PHASER object to act as both slice rephaser and
       slice phaser encoding gradient, which can shorten TE.

    If the KS_PHASER object is initialized with KS_INIT_PHASER, `.nover`, `.nacslines` and `.areaoffset` will be zero, and `.R` will be 1 (steps 3-6 can be skipped)

    Based on the information in the KS_PHASER object, ks_eval_phaser() will set up the `.grad` trapezoid (KS_TRAP), `.numlinestoacq`, and the array `.linetoacq[]`.
    The field `.numlinestoacq` is an integer corresponding to the actual number of lines to acquire, which is also the number of relevant elements in `.linetoacq[]`, containing the complete list
    of phase encoding lines to acquire (honoring partial Fourier, parallel imaging acceleration and ACS lines).

    In the `@pg` section, the ks_pg_phaser() function is used to place the KS_PHASER object on a certain board at some position in time (`.ampscale` must be 1.0 for ks_pg_phaser()).

    To acquire a given phase encoding line in `scan()`, ks_scan_phaser_toline() is called. For a rephaser gradient, which should undo the phase encoding gradient
    after the readout, the function ks_scan_phaser_fromline() is used.

    It is a *requirement* that there is a (*sequence generating*) function in the `@pg` section (containing the ks_pg_phaser() call(s)) that can be run on both HOST and TGT. This
    function should be called once in `cveval()` (after ks_eval_phaser() and other `ks_eval_***()` functions). ks_pg_phaser() will throw an error on TGT if this has not been done.

      myphaseenc.res = opyres * opphasefov; // opyres is the Phase resolution menu in the UI (usually defined as resolution for a full FOV)

    }

/** @brief #### Composite sequence object for EPI readout
    @image html KS_EPI.png KS_EPI
    <br>

    The KS_EPI composite sequence object controls an entire EPI train (including de/rephasers on freq & phase axes). The KS_EPI object consists of several fields, four of which are other sequence objects:
    - KS_READTRAP `.read`: The EPI readout lobes including data acquisition
    - KS_TRAP `.readphaser`: The dephaser and rephaser gradients before and after the core EPI train, on the same board as `.read`
    - KS_TRAP `.blip`: The blip gradients in the phase encoding direction between the readout lobes
    - KS_PHASER `.blipphaser`: The dephaser & rephaser gradients on the same board as the `.blip` gradients.
      For multi-shot EPI these gradients will change in scan() when calling ks_scan_epi_shotcontrol()

    The KS_EPI object is set up in `cveval()` using ks_eval_epi(), but before calling this function, portions of the `.read` field (KS_READTRAP) and `.blipphaser` field (KS_PHASER) must be set up.
    Here follows a minimal list of fields that must be set:
    1. `.read.fov`: The Field-of-View (FOV) in the frequency encoding (readout) direction
    2. `.read.res`: The number of pixels within the FOV along the frequency encoding direction
    3. `.blipphaser.fov`: The Field-of-View (FOV) in the phase encoding direction
    4. `.blipphaser.res`: The number of pixels within the FOV along the phase encoding direction
    5. `.blipphaser.R`: Either the number of EPI shots or the parallel imaging factor
    6. `.read.rampsampling`: Whether rampsampling should be used (see KS_READTRAP). Value of 1 is recommended for EPI
    7. `.read.acq.rbw`: The receiver bandwidth in [kHz/FOV]. Maximum: 250

    If the KS_EPI object is initialized with KS_INIT_EPI on declaration, `.read.rampsampling` will already be set to 1 and `.read.acq.rbw` will be set to 250.0 (hence steps 6-7 can be skipped).

    Single-shot EPI acquisitions are geometrically distorted to some degree depending on chosen `.read.res` and `.blipphaser.fov`. To reduce the EPI distortions, either multi-shot EPI
    or parallel imaging acceleration can be used. For both alternatives, every Rth phase encoding line is acquired in k-space as the EPI train is played out. *R* corresponds to the number
    of shots (`opnshots` menu in the UI) or the parallel imaging factor. Therefore, e.g. a 4-shot EPI readout is identical to an *R* = 4 accelerated EPI readout
    with the same FOV and resolution, why one same field `.R` may be used to control the EPI train setup, be it multi-shot or parallel imaging acceleration (but not both at the same time).
    What differs between multi-shot and parallel imaging acceleration in the acquisition is only whether the `.blipphaser` should change from TR to TR.
    Hence, to set up a KS_EPI object, use the field `.R` for both multi-shot EPI and parallel imaging scenarios.

    The remaining fields of interest in the KS_EPI sequence objects are:
    - `.etl`: This is the echo-train-length (ETL) of the EPI readout train, set by ks_eval_epi() based on `.blipphaser.res` and `.blipphaser.R`
    - `.read_spacing`: Additional spacing in [us] between readout lobes. Default value is zero, but can be set > 0 if additional gradients is to be inserted between the readout lobes.
      One scenario is adding CAIPIRINHA blips on ZGRAD during the time where the EPI readout is played out in the pulse sequence
    - `.duration`: Convenience information for timing calculations, set by ks_eval_epi(). This is the total time in [us] for the EPI train, including the dephasers and rephasers on the frequency and phase axes.
      Note that there are also `.duration` fields for each of the four `KS_***` sequence objects in KS_EPI, stating the duration of each of these components.
    - `.time2center`: Convenience information for timing calculations, set by ks_eval_epi(). The time in [us] from the start of the first dephaser until the center of k-space is reached.
      This deviates from `.duration/2` for partial Fourier EPI trains where `.blipphaser.nover > 0` (a.k.a. fractional NEX, but typically shown as MiniumTE in the UI for EPI)

    It is a *requirement* that there is a (*sequence generating*) function in the `@pg` section (containing the ks_pg_epi() call(s)) that can be run on both HOST and TGT. This
    function should be called exactly once in `cveval()` (after ks_eval_epi() and other `ks_eval_***()` functions). ks_pg_epi() will throw an error on TGT if this has not been done.

/** @brief #### Sets up an acquisition window with a trapezoid, subject to gradient constraints specified as input arguments

    Before calling this function, the following fields in the KS_READTRAP object must be set:
    1. `.fov`: Desired image Field-of-View (FOV) in [mm] along the sequence board one intends to place the KS_READTRAP on (typically XGRAD)
    2. `.res`: Number of pixels within the FOV
    3. `.acq.rbw`: Receiver bandwidth (rBW) in [kHz/FOV]. Maximum is 250
    4. `.rampsampling`: If non-zero, data acquisition will be performed on the ramps of the trapezoid as well. This reduces the readout time, especially for high rBWs.
    5. `.acqdelay`: Needs to be set only if `.rampsampling = 1`. The `.acqdelay` (in [us]) will dictate the time from the start of the ramp-up until
       data acquisition will begin
    6. `.nover`: Number of 'overscans'. If 0, a full echo will be generated (filling k-space). If > 0, fractional echo (i.e. shorter TE) will be set up with
       `.nover` number of extra sample points beyond `.res/2`.
       The total number of samples will be `.res/2 + .nover`. Values of `.nover` between 1 and about 16 should be avoided since half Fourier reconstruction
       methods will likely have difficulties.

    If the KS_READTRAP object is initialized with KS_INIT_READTRAP, the fields `.nover`, `.rampsampling` and `.acqdelay` will all be zero (steps 4-6 can be skipped)

    Based on the information in the KS_READTRAP object, ks_eval_readtrap_constrained() will set up its `.grad` trapezoid (KS_TRAP) and its acquisition
    window `.acq` (KS_READ), constrained by the specified maximum gradient amplitude, slewrate, and minimum plateau time (args 3-5).

    If `.rampsampling = 1`, ks_eval_readtrap_constrained() will also copy the shape of `.grad` to `.omega` (also a KS_TRAP).
    This is needed for FOV-offsets in the readout direction when data acquisition is done on both the ramps and on the plateau,
    and ks_pg_readtrap() and ks_scan_offsetfov() will handle the `.omega` KS_TRAP so that the intended FOV shift in [mm] will be performed.

    ks_eval_readtrap_constrained() will also fill in the convenience fields `.area2center` and `.time2center` properly. `.area2center` is useful to use as `.area`
    for a read dephaser, and `.time2center` makes sequence timing calculations easier. Both fields take partial/full Fourier (`.nover`) into account.

    If ks_eval_readtrap_constrained() returns FAILURE, one must also make sure `cveval()` returns FAILURE, otherwise an error message created in
    ks_eval_readtrap_constrained() will not be seen in the UI.

    There are three wrapper functions to this function (ks_eval_readtrap(), ks_eval_readtrap1(), ks_eval_readtrap2()) that have reduced number of input arguments,

/** @brief #### Sets up a trapezoid for phase encoding, subject to gradient constraints specified as input arguments

    Before calling this function, the following fields in KS_PHASER must be set up:
    1. `.fov`: The desired image Field-of-View (FOV) in [mm] along the sequence board one intends to place the KS_PHASER on (typically YGRAD, for 3D also ZGRAD)
    2. `.res`: The number of pixels within the FOV
    3. `.nover`: Number of 'overscans'. If 0, a full-Fourier k-space will be set up. If > 0, partial Fourier will be set up (shorter scan time) where
       `.nover` number of extra k-space lines beyond `.res/2`. If < 0, partial Fourier will be set up, but with flipped k-space coverage.
       The total number of samples will be `.res/2 + abs(.nover)`. Absolute values of `.nover` between 1 and about 16 should be avoided since
       half Fourier reconstruction methods will likely have difficulties
    4. `.R`: The parallel imaging acceleration factor
    5. `.nacslines`: If `.R > 1`, the value of `.nacslines` is the number of calibration lines around k-space center for parallel imaging calibration
    6. `.areaoffset`: It is possible to embed a static gradient area in the phase encoding functionality of KS_PHASER. This is useful for 3D imaging, where
       the area needed for the rephaser for the slice select gradient can be put into `.areaoffset`. This makes the KS_PHASER to act as both slice rephaser and
       slice phase encoding gradient, which can shorten TE

    If the KS_PHASER object is initialized with KS_INIT_PHASER, `.nover`, `.nacslines` and `.areaoffset` will be zero, and `.R` will be 1 (steps 3-6 can be skipped)

    Based on the information in the KS_PHASER object, ks_eval_phaser_constrained() will set up the `.grad` trapezoid (KS_TRAP). By internally calling
    ks_eval_phaseviewtable(), `.numlinestoacq`, and the array `.linetoacq[]` are also set up.
    The field `.numlinestoacq` is an integer corresponding to the actual number of lines to acquire, and also the number of elements to read in `.linetoacq[]`, containing the complete list

      uses usually `gscale_rfX` CVs with values often between 0.8-0.9. Dividing with this number gives a thicker slice in the calculations. NOTE:
      `.slthick = 0` is accepted and results in zero gradient amplitude with minimal 4us ramps and a plateautime = .rf.rfwave.duration (cf. ks_eval_seltrap()->ks_calc_selgradamp())

   ks_eval_selrf_constrained() checks `.rf.role` to decide on how to set up its gradient objects. The following values of `.rf.role` are allowed:
    - `KS_RF_ROLE_EXC`, indicating an RF *excitation* role. ks_eval_selrf_constrained() will in this case:
      - disable `.pregrad`
      - make `.grad.plateautime` equal to the RF duration (`.rf.rfwave.duration`) and the gradient amplitude (`.grad.amp` [G/cm])
        will be set to the proper value depending on the BW (`.rf.bw`) and slice thickness (`.slthick`).
        The field `.grad.description` will have a ".trap" suffix added to it
      - make `.postgrad` to have a gradient area that rephases the slice. This is dependent on the isodelay of the RF pulse (`.rf.iso2end`) and the slice select
        gradient amplitude (`.grad.amp`). The field `.postgrad.description` will have a ".reph" suffix added to it
    - `KS_RF_ROLE_REF`, indicating an RF *refocusing* role. ks_eval_selrf_constrained() will in this case:
      - use `.pregrad` to make the left crusher (never *bridged* with slice selection). The size of the crusher can be controlled by `.crusherscale`.
        The field `.pregrad.description` will have a ".LC" suffix added to it
      - do the same with `.grad` as done for `KS_RF_ROLE_EXC`
      - use `.postgrad` to make the right crusher (never *bridged* with slice selection). The size of the crusher can be controlled by `.crusherscale`.
        The field `.postgrad.description` will have a ".RC" suffix added to it
    - `KS_RF_ROLE_INV`, indicating an RF *inversion* role. ks_eval_selrf_constrained() will in this case:
      - disable `.pregrad`
      - do the same with `.grad` as done for `KS_RF_ROLE_EXC`
      - disable `.postgrad`
    - `KS_RF_ROLE_SPSAT`, indicating a *spatial RF saturation*. ks_eval_selrf_constrained() will in this case:
      - disable `.pregrad`
      - do the same with `.grad` as done for `KS_RF_ROLE_EXC`
      - use `.postgrad` to make a gradient spoiler (never *bridged* with slice selection). The size of the spoiler can be controlled by `.crusherscale`.
        The field `.postgrad.description` will have a ".spoiler" suffix added to it

    The role `KS_RF_ROLE_CHEMSAT`, indicates a non-slice selective, chemically selective, RF (usually *fat-sat*). ks_eval_selrf_constrained() will in this case throw an error since
      no gradients should be used

    There are three wrapper functions to this function (ks_eval_selrf(), ks_eval_selrf1(), ks_eval_selrf2()) that have reduced number of input arguments,
    and calls ks_eval_selrf_constrained() with different preset gradient constraints. ks_eval_selrf() makes fewest assumptions, making it the most general choice.

    #### Using a custom gradient wave for slice selection (`.gradwave`)
    To support e.g. VERSEd RF excitations, a custom gradient wave can be used. If `.gradwave.res > 0`, ks_eval_selrf_constrained() will disable `.grad` and use `.gradwave` instead.
    When `.rf.role = KS_RF_ROLE_EXC`, the rephasing gradient area (in `.postgrad`) will be calculated by integrating the gradient waveform
    from the RF isocenter to the end. `.gradwave` must be created *before* calling ks_eval_selrf_constrained() using either ks_eval_wave() or ks_eval_wave_file(), and the units must
    be in [G/cm]. To further scale the amplitude of `.gradwave` before calling ks_eval_selrf_constrained(), consider e.g. ks_wave_multiplyval(), ks_wave_absmax(), and possibly
    ks_wave_addval()

/** @brief #### Sets up a KS_EPI composite sequence object, subject to gradients constraints specified as input arguments

    The KS_EPI composite sequence object controls an entire EPI train (including de/rephasers on freq & phase axes).
    Four fields in KS_EPI are other sequence objects:
    - KS_READTRAP `.read`: The EPI readout lobes including data acquisition
    - KS_TRAP `.readphaser`: The dephaser & rephaser gradients before & after the train of readout lobes, on the same board as `.read`
    - KS_TRAP `.blip`: The blip gradients in the phase encoding direction between the readout lobes
    - KS_PHASER `.blipphaser`: The dephaser & rephaser gradients on the same board as the `.blip` gradients.
      For multi-shot EPI these gradients will change in scan() when calling ks_scan_epi_shotcontrol()

    Before calling this function, portions of the `.read` field (KS_READTRAP) and `.blipphaser` field (KS_PHASER) must be set up.
    Here follows a list of fields that must be set:
    1. `.read.fov`: The Field-of-View (FOV) in the frequency encoding (readout) direction
    2. `.read.res`: The number of pixels within the FOV along the frequency encoding direction
    3. `.blipphaser.fov`: The Field-of-View (FOV) in the phase encoding direction
    4. `.blipphaser.res`: The number of pixels within the FOV along the phase encoding direction
    5. `.blipphaser.R`: Either the number of EPI shots or the parallel imaging factor
    6. `.read.rampsampling`: Whether rampsampling should be used (see KS_READTRAP). Value of 1 is recommended for EPI
    7. `.read.acq.rbw`: The receiver bandwidth in [kHz/FOV]. Maximum: 250 (recommended)

    If the KS_EPI object is initialized with KS_INIT_EPI on declaration, `.read.rampsampling` will already be set to 1 and `.read.acq.rbw`
    will be set to 250.0 (hence steps 6-7 can be skipped).

    Single-shot EPI acquisitions are geometrically distorted to some degree depending on chosen `.read.res` and `.blipphaser.fov`. To reduce the EPI distortions, either multi-shot EPI
    or *parallel imaging* acceleration can be used. For both alternatives, every Rth phase ecoding lines are acquired in k-space as the EPI train is played out. *R* corresponds to the number
    of shots (`opnshots` menu in the UI) or the parallel imaging factor. Therefore, e.g. a 4-shot EPI readout is identical to an *R* = 4 accelerated EPI readout
    with the same FOV and resolution, why one same field `.R` may be used to control the EPI train setup, be it multi-shot or parallel imaging acceleration (but not both at the same time).
    What differs between multi-shot and parallel imaging acceleration in the acquisition is only whether the `.blipphaser` should change from TR to TR.
    Hence, to set up a KS_EPI object, use the field `.R` for both multi-shot EPI and parallel imaging scenarios.

    The remaining fields of interest in the KS_EPI sequence objects are:
    - `.etl`: This is the echo-train-length (ETL) of the EPI readout train, set by ks_eval_epi() based on `.blipphaser.res` and `.blipphaser.R`
    - `.read_spacing`: Additional spacing in [us] between readout lobes. Default value is zero, but can be set > 0 if additional gradients is to be inserted between the readout lobes.
      One scenario is adding CAIPIRINHA blips on ZGRAD during the time where the EPI readout is played out in the pulse sequence
    - `.duration`: Convenience information for timing calculations, set by ks_eval_epi(). This is the total time in [us] for the EPI train, including the de/rephasers on the frequency/phase axes.
      Note that there are also `.duration` fields for each of the four `KS_***` sequence objects in KS_EPI, stating the duration of each of these components.
    - `.time2center`: Convenience information for timing calculations, set by ks_eval_epi(). The time in [us] from the start of the first dephaser until the center of k-space is reached.
      This deviates from `<epi>.duration/2` for partial Fourier EPI trains where `.blipphaser.nover > 0` (a.k.a. fractional NEX, but typically shown as MiniumTE in the UI for EPI)

    If peripheral nerve stimulation would be observed, consider calling ks_eval_epi_constrained() with reduced *slewrate*. This will however increase
    the geometric distortions in the images

 *

/**
 * @brief #### Returns the minimum TR based on the content of a slice loop, adding additional time due to SAR and hardware constraints if necessary
 *
 * This function relies on the existence of a slice loop (wrapper) function that can be run on both HOST and TGT. In addition, it needs a KS_SEQ_COLLECTION struct
 * containing references to the sequence modules (KS_SEQ_CONTROL) used in the slice loop.
 * ks_eval_mintr() will call the slice loop, passed in as a function pointer, with *nslices* as the first argument.
 *
 * Different psds have different arguments to their slice loop function depending on what is needed to know for the particular sequence,
 * but a standardized argument list of the sliceloop function is required to allow it to be passed in to ks_eval_mintr().
 * Therefore, a small wrapper function is likely needed for the psd's sliceloop. Moreover, the sliceloop function must return the time in [us] (int) corresponding to the
 * duration to play out the slice loop for *nslices* number of slices. E.g. if there is a psd specific function
 * \code{.c}
   int mysliceloop(int nslices, int ky, int exc, float somecustominfo) {
      int time = 0;

      for (i = 0; i < nslices; i++) {
         time += ks_scan_playsequence(&fatsatseqctrl); // play the fatsat sequence module, and count up fatsatseqctrl.nseqinstances by 1
         time += ks_scan_playsequence(&mymainseqctrl); // play the main sequence, and count up mymainseqctrl.nseqinstances by 1
      }

     return time; // return the duration of the sliceloop given 'nslices' slices.
                  // This time is used to set the scan clock, while the .nseqinstances and .duration fields of each seqctrl struct
                  // is used by ks_eval_gradrflimits() and ks_eval_mintr() to determine the total duration. .nseqinstances must be
                  // known to calculate SAR in order to get the correct number of RF pulses for the slice loop via seqctrl.gradrf.rfptr[]
   }
   \endcode

 * there should be a wrapper function with the following fixed input args:
 * 1. nslices
 * 2. nargs (number of extra arguments)
 * 3. args (pointer to array of `(void *)` for the *nargs* extra arguments)
 *
 * The most important argument is *nslices*, which must be passed to `mysliceloop()` so that different times are returned for different *nslices*. Hence, `mysliceloop()` must
 * also have *nslices* as an input argument.
 *
 * #### Scenario 1:
 * If the remaining arguments to `mysliceloop()` (like *ky*, *exc*, *somecustominfo*) do **not** affect the sequence timing, the sliceloop wrapper function can be written as
 * (using mysliceloop() above):
   \code{.c}
   int mysliceloop_nargs(int nslices, int nargs, void **args) {

      mysliceloop(nslices, 0, 0, 0.0); // args 2-4 are set to 0 since ky, exc, or somecustominfo do not change the sliceloop timing and we will
                                       // only evaluate this on HOST where we are dry-running the sliceloop for timing reasons

  }
  \endcode
 *
 * #### Scenario 2:
 * If some of the remaining arguments to `mysliceloop()` (like *ky*, *exc*, *somecustominfo*) affect the sequence timing, the sliceloop wrapper function can be written as
 * (using mysliceloop() above):
  \code{.c}
  int mysliceloop_nargs(int nslices, int nargs, void **args) {
    int ky = 0;
    int exc = 0;
    float somecustominfo = 0;

    if (nargs >= 1 && args[0] != NULL) {
      ky = *((int *) args[0]); // cast from (void *) to (int *) and dereference
    }
    if (nargs >= 2 && args[1] != NULL) {
      exc = *((int *) args[1]); // cast from (void *) to (int *) and dereference
    }
    if (nargs >= 3 && args[2] != NULL) {
      somecustominfo = *((float *) args[2]); // cast from (void *) to (float *) and dereference
    }

    return mysliceloop(nslices, ky, exc, somecustominfo);
  }
  \endcode
 *
 * For scenario #2, *nargs* and *args* must be set up before calling ks_eval_mintr(), e.g. like:
   \code{.c}
   void *args[] = {(void *) &ky,
                   (void *) &exc,
                   (void *) &somecustominfo}; // pass on the args to mysliceloop() via mysliceloop_nargs()
   int nargs = sizeof(args) / sizeof(void *);

   ks_eval_mintr(nslices, &seqcollection, mysliceloop_nargs, nargs, args);
   \endcode
 *
 *
 * #### Calculation of the minimum TR in three steps using ks_eval_mintr():
 * 1. Set the `.nseqinstances` field to 0 for all KS_SEQ_CONTROL structs being a part of the KS_SEQ_COLLECTION using ks_eval_seqcollection_resetninst()
 * 2. Run the slice loop (wrapper) function for the psd (see above) passed in as a function pointer. This will set the `.nseqinstances` field for each sequence module
 *    equal to the number of playouts of that sequence module in the slice loop
 * 3. Call ks_eval_gradrflimits(), which will
 *    - use the `.nseqinstances` and `.duration` fields of each sequence module to determine the total net duration for the given number of slices
 *    - add potential extra time to keep us within SAR and hardware limits
 *

/**
 * @brief #### Sets the minimum duration and duration fields of a KS_SEQ_CONTROL struct based on some minimum time (arg 2)
 *
 * It is recommended that this function is put at the end of the sequence generating function for the current sequence module (c.f. KS_SEQ_CONTROL), e.g. *mypsd*_pg(), which
 * is a point where one knows how long the pulse sequence is, as the last gradient or RF waveform has been placed out. After passing the known minimum allowed sequence module
 * duration as arg2 to ks_eval_seqctrl_setminduration(), *both* `seqctrl.duration` and `seqctrl.min_duration are set to this minimum value + the SSI time for the sequence module
 * (which must be > 0 before calling this function).
 *
 * This function is only available on HOST for the reason that the `.duration` field should not be reset to the minimum duration on TGT. The recommended order of events is the following:
 *
 * 1. In `cveval()` on HOST: Call *mypsd*_pg(). Having the ks_eval_seqctrl_setminduration() call at the end of *mypsd*_pg(), with the second argument (minimum duration) set to the absolute time corresponding to
 *    the last waveform, it is assured that both `seqctrl.duration` (which can grow bigger later) and `seqctrl.min_duration` (which should not be modified later) is equal to the
 *    same minimum possible value at this point.
 * \code{.c}
  #ifndef IPG // make it explicit that this function is to be called only on HOST (not IPG)
   // ...end of mypsd_pg()...
   // N.B.: .seqctrl.ssi_time must be > 0 before calling ks_eval_seqctrl_setminduration()
   ks_eval_seqctrl_setminduration(&ksfse.seqctrl, tmploc.pos); // tmploc.pos now corresponds to the end of last gradient in the sequence
  #endif
  \endcode
 * 2. In `cveval()` on HOST, after the *mypsd*_pg() call: Do some TR timing calculations and increase the `seqctrl.duration` field(s) for one or more sequence modules to fill up
 *    to the intended TR. The reasons for why `seqctrl.duration` needs to be larger than  `seqctrl.min_duration` could be either that the TR is larger than the minimum possible by
 *    the waveforms, and/or that SAR or hardware constraints (reported back by ks_eval_mintr()) mandates that additional time must be added to the sequence to honor these limits.
 * 3. In `pulsegen()` on TGT (IPG): The *mypsd*_pg() function is called to place out the actual hardware waveforms, followed by the "sequence ending here"-call to KS_SEQLENGTH(), which
 *    is using `seqctrl.duration` to determine the length of the sequence module. As efforts have been made on HOST to set `seqctrl.duration`, we cannot have ks_eval_seqctrl_setminduration()
 *    to reset it again on TGT when *mypsd*_pg() is called. Hence this is why ks_eval_seqctrl_setminduration() is only accessible on HOST

 @brief #### Calculates the ETL index corresponding the desired TE given a KS_PHASER object and echo spacing

 Given the KS_PHASER object used in the FSE train (containing res and partial ky Fourier info),
 the desired effective echo time (`TE` [us]), the echo train length (`etl`) and the echo spacing between
 consecutive echoes (`esp` [us]), this function calculates two echo indices:

 - `bestecho`: is the 0-based index corresponding to the echo in the FSE train that should be placed
   in the center of k-space, i.e. the echo that most closely matches the desired TE. If `bestecho` is
   an integer value (although it is in double format), the data acquired for this echo should *straddle*
   the k-space center. `bestecho` can also be an interger + 0.5, indicating that there are two echo
   indices that should be placed around the k-space center. For example, floor(bestecho) corresponds
   to the echo index that should be placed just below the k-space center and ceil(bestecho) corresponds
   to the echo index that should be placed just above the k-space center. I.e. when `bestecho = *.5`,
   no single echo index will straddle the k-space center, and the k-space line located at ky position
   +0.5 will come from data acquired from echo #[floor(bestecho)] and ky position -0.5 correspondingly
   from echo #[ceil(bestecho)].
 - `optecho`: is the 0-based index corresponding to an ideal TE choice that would allow the data from the
   echoes in the FSE train to be placed out linearly each time. Doing so will reduce ghosting and T2
   blurring. Hence, `optecho` ignores the input TE value here, but the calling function can use this
   information to determine k-space acquisition order, but also to suggest a TE (optecho * esp) that
   would result in optimal image quality for the chosen ETL.

 @param[out] bestecho Pointer to the echo number in the train that should be placed at the center of

 *******************************************************************************************************
 @brief #### 2DFSE: Makes a KS_PHASEENCODING_PLAN depending on etl, desired TE, and echo spacing (esp)

 This function is only executed on TGT and will return early when called on HOST.

 The phase encoding sorting is depending on many factors. First, the desired TE will dictate which one
 (or two) of the echoes in the FSE train (of length `etl`) that should be placed in the center. This
 is determined based on the properties of the KS_PHASER object (phase encoding gradients in the FSE train),
 `TE` and `esp` by calling ksfse_calc_echo().

 Second, the sorting of the echoes will first of all depend on whether `bestecho` is equal to `optecho`.
 If it is, then the `etl` echoes can be placed out linearly in k-space (from the bottom->top of k-space,
 or vice versa). This will produce the best image quality with minimal T2-blurring and FSE ghosting.

 As partial ky Fourier is allowed, this function first checks on which side (top or bottom half) of k-space
 that has more room for the echo indices that are either before or after the `bestecho` index corresponding
 to the desired `TE`. The goal with this is to try to sweep k-space as linearly as possible in as much
 of the center portion of k-space as possible when `bestecho != optecho`.

 When `bestecho != optecho`, there will be data from either the first or last echo indices that won't fit
 in k-space if placed next to a neighboring index. If this data would be placed on the other size of
 k-space (that still needs lines to be filled in), where e.g. echo index #0 would be placed next to echo
 index #(etl-1), strong ghosting will occur due to the much strong signal from echo #0 compared to #(etl-1).
 With an echo train length of `etl`, k-space is filled in `numshots = ceil(numlinestoacq / etl`. Using
 half of the numshots lines for each echo index a linear sweep of the center half of k-space can is layed
 out. To avoid FSE ghosting, the numshots/2 remaining lines for each early or late echo index are placed
 such as neighboring ky lines will never have a change in echo index by more than one. For example if
 `etl = 8`, `esp = 10 ms` and `TE = 25`, then `bestecho = 1.5` and `optecho = 4.5`. We avoid to sort the
 echoes in the following k-space order for ghosting reasons:
 7-6-0-1*2-3-4-5 (* = k-space center)
 since there will be a strong discontinuity between 6 and 0.
 Instead we use groups of numshots/2 per echo index (and get two groups per echo index in k-space):
 5-4-3-2-1-0-0-1*2-3-4-5-6-7-6-5

 The etl is the number of readouts in the EPI train, derived from the phaser. The number of ky shots is
 also given by the phaser, while the number of kz shots is given by zphaser. Any partial fourier is
 handled by the phasers, and acceleration and acs lines in the z direction is handled by zphaser. For 3D
 EPI, the number of shots in the phase encoding plan will be the product of the number of shots in the

 Each shot will be played out in a single kz plane. The shot order will be linear in ky and kz. The ky
 shots will be in the inner loop, unless kzshotsfirst is TRUE.

    The same KS_TRAP object can be freely placed on XGRAD, YGRAD and ZGRAD
    as many times as desired, by only changing the second argument each time (to avoid waveform overlaps). The second argument is a KS_SEQLOC struct with three fields:

    - `.ampscale`: A factor that must be in range [-1.0,1.0] that is multiplied with `.amp` to yield a per-instance (i.e. per-placement) amplitude ([G/cm]).
    The simplest is to use 1.0, which makes the KS_TRAP object to be placed out on the board as initially designed using ks_eval_trap(). For the OMEGA board, this factor
    must be 1.0.

/** @brief #### Places a KS_WAVE sequence object on a board at some position in the pulse sequence

    This function should be called in the `@pg` section to place out a KS_WAVE sequence object that creates an arbitrary waveform in the pulse sequence.
    The same KS_WAVE object can be placed on any board as many times as desired, by only changing the second argument each time
    (to avoid waveform overlaps). However, the RHO (RF) board should be avoided as this bypasses RF scaling and SAR calculations, providing no control over the flip angle.
    For RF waveforms, always use KS_RF (or KS_SELRF). The second argument is a KS_SEQLOC struct with three fields:
    - `.board`: Choose between XGRAD, YGRAD, ZGRAD, OMEGA, THETA
    - `.pos`: Absolute time in [us] of the start of the waveform. For `RF`, OMEGA and THETA, `pos_rf_wait` will be added to this time to take system delays into account
    - `.ampscale`: For gradient boards, this factor must be in range [-1.0,1.0] that is multiplied with the waveform to yield a per-instance (i.e. per-placement)
    amplitude ([G/cm]). For THETA, only values of +1.0 and -1.0 is allowed, and for OMEGA only 1.0 is allowed

    The KS_WAVE sequence object contains a KS_WAVEFORM (float[KS_MAXWAVELEN]) to hold the waveform. The physical unit of the waveform in the KS_WAVE
    object depends the board on which it is placed using ks_pg_wave(). For the
    - gradient boards (XGRAD, YGRAD, ZGRAD), the unit is [G/cm]
    - THETA board, the unit is [degrees]
    - RF (RHO) and OMEGA boards, the units are arbitrary (c.f. ks_eval_rf() and ks_eval_wave()). Don't call ks_pg_wave() directly to place a KS_WAVE on the RF board

    When a waveform is placed on OMEGA, neither the waveform amplitude nor the `.ampscale` (in KS_SEQLOC) affects the final frequency modulation.
    Instead the run-time amplitude of a KS_WAVE object on the OMEGA board is controlled in scan() via a function called ks_scan_omegawave_hz(), where the largest value
    in the field `.waveform[]` in the KS_WAVE will correspond to the value in [Hz] provided.

    If the `.duration` field in the KS_WAVE object is 0, ks_pg_wave() will return SUCCESS and quietly ignore placing it out. This is a part of the mechanism that setting
    the `.duration` field to 0 in `cveval()` should eliminate its existance in both timing calulations and in the pulse sequence generation in `@pg`

    All KS_WAVE objects are double buffered in ks_pg_wave() so that waveforms can be replaced in run-time (scan()) using ks_scan_wave2hardware()

    Regardless of the order placed out in the `@pg` section, and on which boards (XGRAD, YGRAD, ZGRAD) the KS_WAVE object is placed,
    the *instance* number of the KS_WAVE is automatically sorted in time. If two instances of one KS_WAVE occur at the same time (`.pos`) on different boards,

/** @brief #### Places a KS_RF sequence object on a board at some position in the pulse sequence

    This function should be called in the `@pg` section to place out a KS_RF sequence object that creates an RF pulse in the pulse sequence.
    The same KS_RF object can be placed out as many times as desired, by only changing the second argument each time
    (to avoid waveform overlaps). The second argument is a KS_SEQLOC struct with three fields:
    - `.board`: *Ignored*. `.rfwave` will always be placed on RHO. If the resolution of `.omegawave` is non-zero it will be placed on OMEGA, and
      correspondingly for `.thetawave` on THETA
    - `.pos`: Absolute time in [us] of the start of the waveform
    - `.ampscale`: A factor that must be in range [-1.0,1.0] that is multiplied with `.amp` to yield a per-instance (i.e. per-placement) amplitude. For KS_RF objects
      this will cause the flip angle to be reduced on a per-instance basis. This can be used to generate a variable flip-angle train of RF pulses using a single KS_RF object.
      An `.ampscale` of -1.0 is equivalent to adding a 180 degree RF phase shift to the RF pulse

    If the `rfwave.duration` field in the KS_RF object is 0, ks_pg_rf() will return SUCCESS and quietly ignore placing it out. This is a part of the mechanism that setting
    the `.duration` field to 0 in `cveval()` should eliminate its existance in both timing calulations and in the pulse sequence generation in `@pg`

    As ks_pg_rf() internally calls ks_pg_wave() for its KS_WAVEs, double buffering will be used for all hardware waveforms, allowing waveforms to be replaced in
    run-time (scan()) using ks_scan_wave2hardware()

    Regardless of the order placed out in the `@pg` section the KS_RF object is placed, the *instance* number of the KS_RF is automatically sorted in time.
    These abstract, sorted, instance numbers are used by `ks_scan_***()` functions in scan() to refer to a specific instance of a KS_RF object in the sequence.

    GENERAL NOTE: It is a **requirement** that the function in the `@pg` section containing all `ks_pg_***()` calls is also called exactly once in `cveval()` after
    the calls to the corresponding `ks_eval_***()` functions that design the KS_*** sequence objects. Each `ks_pg_***()` will throw an error if this has not been done.

    When ks_pg_rf() is run in `cveval()` (on HOST), the field `.rfpulse.activity` that was first set to 0 by ks_eval_rf() is now set to
    `PSD_APS2_ON + PSD_MPS2_ON + PSD_SCAN_ON` by ks_pg_rf().
    This triggers the RF functions used in ks_eval_gradrflimits() to include this KS_RF object in RF scaling and SAR calculations. Each time ks_pg_rf() is called, the
    field `.rfpulse.num` is incremented after being first set to 0 by ks_eval_rf(). Hence, it is crucial that the *sequence generating* function (c.f. KS_SEQ_CONTROL)
    containing all `ks_pg_***()` calls is executed between the ks_eval_rf() setup call and the call to ks_eval_gradrflimits()

/** @brief #### Places a KS_SELRF sequence object on a gradient (and RF) board at some position in the pulse sequence

    This function should be called in the `@pg` section to place out a KS_SELRF sequence object that creates an RF pulse with associated trapezoids in the pulse sequence.
    The same KS_SELRF object can be placed out as many times as desired, by only changing the second argument each time
    (to avoid waveform overlaps). The second argument is a KS_SEQLOC struct with three fields:
    - `.board`: Choose between XGRAD, YGRAD, ZGRAD for the board on which `.pregrad`, `.grad` (or `.gradwave`) and `.postgrad` should be placed
    - `.pos`: Absolute time in [us] of the start of the `.pregrad` attack ramp. If `.pregrad` has zero duration, `.pos` will in effect refer to the start of the `.grad`
      attack ramp
    - `.ampscale`: A factor that must be in range [-1.0,1.0] that is multiplied with `rf.rfwave.amp` to yield a per-instance (i.e. per-placement) amplitude. For KS_SELRF objects
      the `.ampscale` value will be passed on its internal call to ks_pg_rf(), but not to its internal ks_pg_trap() calls. Hence `.ampscale` will
      have the same effect for ks_pg_selrf() as for ks_pg_rf(), with no per-instance control of the amplitude of the gradients involved. A reduced `.ampscale`
      will cause the flip angle to be reduced on a per-instance basis. This can be used to generate a variable flip-angle train of selective RF pulses using a single
      KS_SELRF object. An `.ampscale` of -1.0 is equivalent to adding a 180 degree RF phase shift to the RF pulse

    If the `.gradwave` field has a non-zero resolution, ks_pg_selrf() will place out the `.gradwave` (KS_WAVE) instead of the `.grad` (KS_TRAP) during the time the RF
    pulse is played out. An error is thrown if `.gradwave.duration` (if `.gradwave.res` > 0) is not equal to the `.rf.rfwave.duration`. If `.pregrad` or `.postgrad` has
    zero duration, they will not be placed out. The *existance* of non-zero `.pregrad` and `.postgrad` is determined by ks_eval_selrf() based on `.rf.role`

    As ks_pg_selrf() internally calls ks_pg_wave() for its KS_WAVEs, hardware double buffering will be used for all waveforms, allowing waveforms to be replaced in
    run-time (scan()) using ks_scan_wave2hardware()

/** @brief #### Places out an intersequence interrupt at a specific time in the sequence module

    This function connects the execution of a psd-specific rotation function in realtime when time passes this point in the
    sequence. This is done by two KS_WAIT pulses (being part of KS_ISIROT) on the SSP board.

    Example of use in a `myseqmodule_pg()` function of the sequence module (in pulsegen()):

    \code{.c}
    // add some padding time before the SSP pulses (not well tested how much of KS_ISI_predelay that is necessary)
    mypos += RUP_GRD(KS_ISI_predelay);

    status = ks_pg_isirot(&myisirot, myscaninfo, mypos, myisirotatefun, myseqctrl);
    if (status != SUCCESS) return status;

    // add some padding time after the SSP pulses (not well tested how much of KS_ISI_postdelay that is necessary)
    mypos += RUP_GRD(myisirot.duration + KS_ISI_postdelay);
    \endcode

    where the psd-specific rotation function is declared as:

    \code{.c}
    // Intra sequence interrupts placed as WAIT pulses on the SSP board may be used to call for an immediate
    // rotation of the logical coordinate system in real time as these WAIT pulses are played out, as
    // opposed to during the SSI time for the sequence module.
    // The WAIT pulse is assigned a control number (isi number) that is then connected to this void function
    // using `isivector()` in ks_pg_isirot(). No input arguments can be passed to this function. Instead the
    // rotation information specific to the sequence module is provided in `myscaninfo.oprot`. The acutal
    // rotation work, incl. keeping track of number of isi pulses played out is done by ks_scan_isirotate().
    void myisirotatefun() {

    #ifdef IPG
      ks_scan_isirotate(&myisirot);
    #endif

    }
    \endcode
    Note that the only difference between the psd-specific `myisirotatefun()` and the general ks_scan_isirotate() is that
    `myisirotatefun()` has no input arguments. Input arguments cannot be used as it is called from an interrupt routine,
    not from some other parent function.

    Care must be taken when mixing the use of ks_scan_rotate() (executing during the SSI time) and these ISI interrupts, so
    that they are executed in the correct order. One way is to consistently avoid the use of ks_scan_rotate() and instead
    return to the prescribed slice rotation by calling ks_pg_isirot() again, last in the same `myseqmodule_pg()` function,
    this time using the prescribed scan_info struct:

    \code{.c}
    status = ks_pg_isirot(&myisirot, ks_scan_info[0], mypos, myisirotatefun, myseqctrl);

    This function should be called in the `@pg` section to place out a KS_EPI sequence object that creates an EPI readout including dephaser and rephaser gradients.
    The moments of all trapezoids in the KS_EPI object sum to zero on the two axes the KS_EPI object is placed on. The KS_EPI object is to be placed on two out of three
    gradients, why special values for the field `loc.board` must be used. The value should state which logical board (X,Y or Z) that should be used for the readout
    lobes (FREQ) and which logical board (X, Y or Z) that should be used for the blips (PHASE). One example is KS_FREQX_PHASEY, which will put the EPI readout lobes on
    XGRAD and the phase encoding blips on YGRAD

    The same KS_EPI object can be placed out 16 times per sequence. This limitation is due to the hard limitation on the number of echoes (i.e. different k-spaces per image
    plane and image volume) that can be acquired per scan. Each time an instance of the KS_EPI object is placed out using ks_pg_epi(), the second argument
    (the KS_SEQLOC struct) should be modified:
    - `.board`: Choose between `KS_FREQX_PHASEY`, `KS_FREQY_PHASEX`, `KS_FREQX_PHASEZ`, `KS_FREQZ_PHASEX`, `KS_FREQY_PHASEZ`, `KS_FREQZ_PHASEY`
    - `.pos`: Absolute time in [us] of the start of the first dephaser gradient
    - `.ampscale`: For KS_EPI objects, valid values are only +1.0 and -1.0, and this will control the polarity of the first readout gradient. This is rarely needed, and 1.0
      should be the standard choice as this does only affect gradient delays and Nyquist ghosting, not the geometric distortion direction.

    The *sign* of the EPI blips will control the direction of the geometric distortions, and this is *not* done via `.ampscale` but in run-time using ks_scan_epi_shotcontrol()
